There are times that we have some code in our working directory
	that we want to throw away

git status -s
 M	file1.js
??	file2.js
			//to undo this changes
			git restore .
			git status -s
				?? file2.js
					but file is still here. Why is that?
					This is a new untracked file. 

git clean		
	git clean -f
