Reset is not a option here, because we don't want to drop the commit that we shared with other.

git revert HEAD

#range, between the last three commits
git revert HEAD~3..HEAD		#git doesn't include parents commit, h2-h
				# we can simplefy is
					HEAD~3..

			# + (console), some changes in our staging area
				git status -s


git reset --hard HEAD~3
