Centralized
	single repository that is shared by all team members.
		Problem
			Everyone is dependent on this central repository. 
			If the server go offline, no one can commit or view the project

Distributed
	Every developer has repository on their machine. They can work offline with their local repository

	How we can collaborate with this model?
		We can synchronize our work directly with each other
		Cyntralized workflow
			Everyone has a local repository, but there's also a
				central repository


				Centalized Workflow
	some commits					some commits
John	---push--->		Central repository	---pull--->	Amy	


				Intergration-Manager (open-source project)

Project		----fork--->					Repository	(fork repository)
	^								|		^
	push local repository								clone		push (next we send pull request to maintainer)
	|								|		
			(the maintainer is notfited, review them)	|
maintainer		<---pull request---			contributor	(do some commits)
have push acces							the problem, we cannot trust them enough to give them push write-access to our repository
