Merging
	bring the changes from one branch to another

in git we have 2 types of merges

	fast-forward merges
		if branches have not diverged

			Master
			|
		()<-()<-()
			|
			Bugfix

				#Now we switch to the bugfix branch, and make a couple of commits
			
			Master
			|
		()<-()<-()<-()<-()<-()
				     |
				     Bugfix

				#Now we need to bring the changes back to master
					#because these branches have not diverged and 
					#there is a direct linear path from bug fix to master
					#all git has to do
						#to merge the changes
							# is to bring the master pointer forward
								# we can remove bugfix pointer
				
	3-way merges
		if branches have diverged

			Master			#When we move master to the last commit, we have some changes in master
			|			#they don't exist in the bugfix change. If we run a merge, git cannot move the master pointer forward.
		()<-()<-()<-()			#Otherwise we will last the latest commit in the master branch
			|
			()<-()
			    |
			    Bugfix

			#If we wanna merge, we create  commit that combines these two changes
				Master
				  |
		()<-()<-()<-() <-()
			 \	/
			  ()<-()
			       |
			     Bugfix
