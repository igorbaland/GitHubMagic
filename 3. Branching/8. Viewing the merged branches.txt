Typically when we are done with branch, we should merge to master and delete the branch.
Sometimes we forget to delete the branch.

# view the list of branches that we have merged
git branch --merged
  bugfix/login-form
  bugfix/signup-form
  feature/change-password

	The best practice
	we are done and merged it 
		we must to delete the branch
			because in the future we can get confused
		
		git branch -d bugfix/login-form
			deleteted branch..

		#return a list of branches that are not have been merged to the current merge	
		git branch --no-merged
