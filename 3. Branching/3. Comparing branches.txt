#show me all commits that are in bugfix branch but not are in master
git log master..bugfix/signup-form

	#actually changes and not the list of commits
	git diff master..bugfix/signup-form

		#shorter way, because we on master, we don't need to type "master.."
		git diff bugfix/signup-form

			#sometimes, we don't want to see the changes
			#what files are going to be affected
			git diff --name-only bugfix/signup-form		#or name-status
